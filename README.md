[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HarmonEpsilon/abstract-rs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HarmonEpsilon/abstract-rs)

Fiction queue management webapp to be used by reviewers and prereaders.

Still Work-In-Progress.

If you would like to contribute, please message me.

To build and compile, check `rustup toolchain list ` and make sure `nightly-2017-03-16-x86_64` is set to the default.

If you do not have Rust, please navigate to https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/ and install the latest nightly using `rustup`.
If you do not have the correct nightly version installed, use `rustup default [Rust version]` to acquire it.
Then, clone this repository and navigate to its directory on your computer and run `cargo run` in Terminal or Command Prompt.
